# Real-Estate-Development
DataVisualization - DataModeling - DataIntegration
This Real Estate Development Project is about investigating the number and total price of contracted and reserved units and its trend.
 - I’ve gathered data from CSV files and excel files.
 - Then, I performed ETL jobs to transform data types and reformat tables to fit the analysis process and requirements.
 - I’ve created a data model concerning business requirements and relations between tables.
 - In my estimation, I decided to use the snowflake dimension (Account dimension) and make it in one many relationships with booking.
 - Finally, I built a dashboard using:
    KPIS, BarCharts, BieCharts, and Trend lines
